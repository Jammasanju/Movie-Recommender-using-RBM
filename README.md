# Movie-Recommender-using-RBM
A Movie Recommender System using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) approach used is collaborative filtering.

RBM is a Generative model with two layers(Visible and Hidden) that assigns a probability to each possible *binary state vectors* over its visible units. Visible layer nodes have *visible bias(vb)* and Hideen layer nodes have *hidden bias(hb)*. A weight matrix of row length equal to input nodes and column length equal to output nodes.
