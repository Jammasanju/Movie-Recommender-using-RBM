# Movie-Recommender-using-RBM
A Movie Recommender System using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) approach used is collaborative filtering. This system is an algorithm that recommends items by trying to find users that are similar to each other based on their item ratings.

RBM is a Generative model with two layers(Visible and Hidden) that assigns a probability to each possible *binary state vectors* over its visible units. Visible layer nodes have *visible bias(vb)* and Hideen layer nodes have *hidden bias(hb)*. A weight matrix of row length equal to input nodes and column length equal to output nodes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 and above
